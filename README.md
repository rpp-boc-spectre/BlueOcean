# Welcome to ZAP!
This was a month long project where our team completed an MVP full stack application for an external user.

# What does it do
Users can record/upload audio to a _Track_ as a _Layer_. Users can then edit the layer's audio via sliders to affect tempo, pitch, and volume. Users can add up to 4 layers to each track.

Then, the layer can be saved with a name, tag, and publicity status. Any track listed as private is not shown on the home page.
